# Note Taker

This repo is for module eleven's challenge assignment.

## Description

The challenge is an On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge (begin with starter code that you need to modify). The goal is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to utilize the skills I've learned in Express.js. The problem it solved was to create a Note Taker app to write and save notes so that we can access them later to study and review.
